## Overview

Accessible FAQ accordion with responsive layout and smooth transitions.

Made with the accessibility requirements in mind and can be used with assistive technology.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
